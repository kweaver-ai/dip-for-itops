## Introduction

DIP for ITOps (Data Intelligence Platform for IT Operations) is an AI agent application collection built on the DIP platform, focusing on intelligent IT operations. It aims to achieve automation, intelligence, and decision optimization in IT operations through knowledge-driven and AI-enhanced operations agents. By integrating multi-source heterogeneous machine data and unified governance of machine data, based on operations knowledge networks and operations agents, it enables intelligent operations in scenarios such as efficient analysis of alert events, rapid root cause localization and remediation, application health analysis and assessment, and intelligent querying of machine data, helping operations personnel improve IT operations efficiency and ensure business continuity.

## Key Values

- **Eliminate Machine Data Silos**: DIP for ITOps integrates multi-source heterogeneous machine data through data virtualization technology, eliminating machine data silos.
- **Efficient Correlation Analysis**: Through operations knowledge networks, it weaves machine data into operations knowledge, enabling efficient correlation analysis of machine data.
- **Operations-Assisted Decision Making**: Based on AI large models and operations knowledge networks, operations agents assist operations personnel in making operations decisions, achieving a "perception-analysis-decision-execution" closed loop, compensating for the lack of personal experience of operations personnel.
- **Extensible Scenario Applications**: Built-in rich operations agents, observability object models, and machine data models, covering major IT operations scenarios. At the same time, it supports rapid expansion of scenario applications and can be flexibly configured and extended according to scenario requirements.

## Scenario Applications

### 1. Alert and Fault Analysis (ITOps Alert Analysis)
Alert and Fault Analysis is a powerful troubleshooting tool designed for operations personnel. The application provides intelligent alert convergence and fault traceability analysis capabilities, automatically converging discrete alerts into fault points and aggregating them into complete operations problems. It includes the following key capabilities:
- **Alert Convergence**: Converge and aggregate alerts into faults, assessing the scope and severity of fault impact.
- **Traceability Analysis**: Restore the process of fault occurrence.
- **Root Cause Localization**: Efficiently locate fault root causes.
